# A-Small-Fishing-Vessel-Recognition-Method-
This project is a novel method for recognizing small fishing vessels based on laser sensors. Using four types of small fishing vessels as targets, a recognition method for small fishing vessels based on Markov transition field (MTF) time-series images and VGG-16 transfer learning is proposed.
